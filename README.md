# Year 1 Design Study

This group project was done as part of the Engineering Practice (Design Study) module at the end of Year 1 of the Materials Science program at Imperial College London. 
For this group project, I was Chief of Automation and Control, overseeing the circuit design and programming.

The project involves the automation of a rheometer built from scratch using an Ardunio UNO R3 microcontroller. The language used is the Arduino Programming Language,
which is a framework built in C++.

The purpose of the code was to automate a motor within the rheometer such that it would spin at 10 different speeds and take electrical measurements from which the
shear rate and shear stress of the liquid could be calculated. At the end of this process, the data could be plotted using a Python file.
